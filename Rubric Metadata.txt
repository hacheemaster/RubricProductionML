Instructions:
• One point for executing the test manually and documenting and distributing the result.
• One point if there is a system in place that can run the test automatically on a repeated basis. 
The final score is the minimum of the scores aggregated for each of the 4 sections.


Results:
• 0 points: More of a research project than a productionized system.
• 1-2 points: Not totally untested, but it is worth considering the possibility of serious holes
in reliability.
• 3-4 points: There’s been first pass at basic productionization, but additional investment may
be needed.
• 5-6 points: Reasonably tested, but it’s possible that more of those tests and procedures may
be automated.
• 7-10 points: Strong levels of automated testing and monitoring, appropriate for mission-
critical systems.
• 12+ points: Exceptional levels of automated testing and monitoring.
